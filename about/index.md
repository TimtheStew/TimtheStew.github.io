# Hello!

My name is Tim Stewart, and I'm a software engineer from Pennsylvania. I got 
my BS in Computer Science from Temple University in Philadelphia in 2019. Currently
employed for Magnus Health / Veracross. 


## This Blog
I originally started this blog while applying to jobs post college, as 
sort of an extended resume. It still serves that purpose, so currently most of the 
content is looking back on projects I've already done. I've got some other projects 
in the works though, so hopefully you'll see posts about them on here someday soon. 

There are some other hobbies of mine, like photography, that I might
find a home for here if I start to pursue or organize them more. 

Speaking of, the background photo and the ones on this page were all
taken at Longwood gardens. Would highly recommend if you find yourself
around the West Chester/King of Prussia area of Pennsylvania.
