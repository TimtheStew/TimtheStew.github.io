And, here comes the mistake, I took that\nconfidence and extended it into C++, thinking something along the lines of “C++ is just\nC with classes”. </p>\n<p>This statement is in a sense “technically” true, but also very misleading. The reality of writing\nC++, especially more modern C++11, or 14 (or 17), is very different to writing C. </p>\n<p>This became especially apparent when we were discussing our solutions to the first portion\nof the project in class. Where some of my classmates had made quick work of adding\nthe extent functionality required by using C++ STL utilities like maps and vectors, I had\ndone everything C-style with arrays and far more pointer headaches than necessary. </p>\n<p>To be continued…</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"YFS - A Distributed Filesystem Retrospective - WIP","date":"March 25, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/YFS-Retrospective/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Umbrella-Chat-Announcement/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Project!
