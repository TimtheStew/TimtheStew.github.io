Been working on some\nretrospectives of the projects I’ve got on my resume, hoping to start this blog\nas sort of an extension of my resume actually, so if anyone is interested in\nmy projects they can come read about them here. </p>\n<p>Beyond that I’m hoping to do\nsome write-ups of the technologies and techniques involved in those projects,\nlike fourier analysis or OpenGL for the visualizer and the dope algorithms\nused in (or just related to) the YFS file system. I’ll also be putting any\ninteresting tidbits related to future projects here. Maybe I’ll do a post about\nGatsby, because although I’m sure there are already many, many such posts\naround, none of them are mine!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World!
