The only goal we had to drop entirely\nwas putting game logic on the blockchain, as research quickly showed it would\nrequire people to spend an unreasonable amount of ether on playing a game, so\nwe marked it as unfeasible. </p>\n<p>Some other smaller features also had to be dropped. We wanted to store the art\nfor the cards on the blockchain as well, but it also appeared unfeasible.\nI was supposed to develop a ranked matchmaking system for players, but had to\ngo for random matches instead, unfortunately not because it wasn’t feasible but\nbecause I was running out of time, for reasons you’ll find below.</p>\n<h3>Mistakes</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail</p>\n<p> <cite> Benjamin Franklin </cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are two big mistakes I want to talk about here, one pertinent to the\nwhole team, and one more on me personally. Both revolve around preparation. </p>\n<p>As a team, we didn’t invest enough effort in planning our project, both through user\nstories and more general architecture, such as block, sequence, or module diagrams.\nWhile we were required to create all that documentation and stories and post them to\nthe management system the class was using, we sometimes just phoned it in - not\nreally going into the amount of detail we should have. </p>\n<p>This became apparent\nlater on in the development process, when we encountered parts of the system\nthat didn’t work together as they should have even when implemented correctly,\nor that left functionality gaps, forcing us to shove what we needed where it\nwould fit, never a good strategy when dealing with this many moving parts.  </p>\n<p>It was shocking how much smoother things were moving on the modules with proper design,\njust pick up a task, implement the required small bit of functionality, run\nthe tests, rinse, and repeat until you logged your hours for the day. In contrast,\nwhen things were ambiguous, even a task that should have been run of the mill could\nrequire you to talk to 2 or 3 different team members about how something should be\ndone. And once a couple such pieces of functionality have been added, if not properly\ndocumented, they can snowball into complicating even well planned parts of the system.</p>\n<p>While we all participated in the design and, to an extent, the implementation of the\nentire project, early on we split into three two-person teams, one focused on the\nsmart contracts, one on the main website, and one on the game. I was on the game team.</p>\n<p>The more personal mistake I want to talk about involves a lack of preparation with regards\nto developing multiplayer browser games. While I did some small demos and tutorials to\nget a feel for the tools involved (<a href=\"https://phaser.io/\">phaser</a> and\n<a href=\"https://socket.io/\">socket.io</a> mostly) I didn’t do much research into the common\npatterns and best practices used in the design of such programs.</p>\n<p>This meant when I initially designed\nthe structure of the games objects and interactions, not only were my chunks not as\nefficient and self-contained as they easily could have been - I also alienated myself\nfrom a good portion of the resources available to me. No one online can help me\nunderstand why my janky resource system sometimes doesn’t update when it should, when\nnone of my events to trigger such an update are patterns used by others. If I had followed\nthrough with the tutorials I started instead of just stopping when I knew I could get\nthe functionality I wanted, I would be able to continue to draw on them. </p>\n<p>Another related problem was that this was my first real exposure to anything more than\ntrivial javascript. So while I did spend a good deal of time researching and learning\nthroughout the project, a lot of that was focused on learning the in’s and out’s of\nJS, and ES6 in particular. I did come out of it with a much more positive view of JS\nthan I had before though. I used to think of it as kind of a joke, knowing it mostly for\nit’s meme-y quirks surrounding type coercion. </p>\n<p>This lack of javascript knowledge lead to some terrible initial designs based using\nprototypical inheritance, and an eventual switch to ES6 - which I should’ve just used\nfrom the beginning. </p>\n<p>A more minor (technically speaking) issue with the whole project was that the card game\nwe designed was by no means balanced, or even really that fun. But as none of us really\nstudied any game design in that sense, and it didn’t impact the ability of the game to\nbe played, I don’t view it as that big of a problem. People still play monopoly, even\nwhen vastly superior board games are available!</p>\n<h3>What Went Well</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, we did manage to pull off most of the functionality. Using a chrome\nplugin to connect to their wallet, users could purchase cards for Ether on the site, and\nthen create an auction to sell them\nif they wanted, or put them into a deck, and (if they were\nlucky) load that deck into the game to play with. While not entirely bug-free, and\ncertainly not as pretty as we’d hoped, everything did work correctly for the final demo.\n(though due to the planning mistakes outlined above, not much earlier than that)</p>\n<p>While the site’s interaction with the smart contracts and the game were tricky and took\nmany more redesigns and ad hoc adjustments than anyone sensible would admit to,\nthe actual site itself was mostly smooth sailing, based on a <a href=\"http://mern.io/\">MERN</a> stack\n(MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) it had an account system, an inventory management page,\nand an auction house, as well pages for describing the game and how the cards worked.</p>\n<p>Thanks to a lot of similar work on non-fungible token systems on the blockchain, see\n<a href=\"https://www.cryptokitties.co/\">CryptoKitties,</a> the blockchain work went fairly well, at least\nas far I know, only being at best semi-involved in that part of the project.</p>\n<p>Something I’m proud of is the zone system I made for the game-board, that allowed easy drag and\ndropping of cards from hands to the battlefield, as well as summary state updates to be sent\nbetween players as they took actions. It was incredibly satisfying the first time I played a card as player\n1 and saw the card appear in the appropriate spot for player 2. Phaser was a lot of fun to work with, and is fairly\nwell documented. </p>\n<p>Another good part was the art for the game, sometimes we would take breaks during long frustrating\nnights coding in a CS lounge on campus and just make pixel art for the cards. While none of it was\nawe-inspiring, it was a lot of fun to make, and even made a card poking (light-hearted) fun at our professor.</p>\n<h3>Big Lessons</h3>\n<p>Overall, I think there are three big takeaways from my experience with this project.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More work in the design stage means less frustration in the implementation stage</li>\n<li>Best practices and common patterns are widely used for a reason, and to be ignorant of\nthem risks cutting yourself off from potential resources</li>\n<li>Build familiarity with tools on small projects before you attempt to design large projects\nto be built with them</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"CryptoCards - A Blockchain Cardgame Retrospective","date":"February 17, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/CryptoCards-Blockchain-Cardgame-Retrospective/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Hello-World/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Frequency-Visualizer-Retrospective/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Frequency Visualizer Retrospective"}}}}
