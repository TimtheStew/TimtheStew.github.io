Check out the source\n<a href=\"https://github.com/nickk752/CryptoCards\">here.</a> In this post I’ll try to\nbreak down what we did right, mistakes we made, and things that I learned along the way. </p>\n<h3>Initial Project Goals</h3>\n<p>When we first set out, we had some very high hopes for this website, that\nfrom a high level looked like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can buy and sell cards on the site via auctions on the blockchain</li>\n<li>Users can combine cards to create new ones</li>\n<li>Users can build decks with their cards, and battle via a browser-based game</li>\n<li>Game logic on the blockchain to prevent cheating</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’m happy to say we did eventually provide most of that functionality, though\nat the expense of some visual polish. The only goal we had to drop entirely\nwas putting game logic on the blockchain, as research quickly showed it would\nrequire people to spend an unreasonable amount of ether on playing a game, so\nwe dropped it as unfeasible. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"CryptoCards - A Blockchain Cardgame Retrospective","date":"February 17, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/CryptoCards-Blockchain-Cardgame-Retrospective/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Hello-World/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Frequency-Visualizer-Retrospective/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Frequency Visualizer Retrospective"}}}}
