Check out the source\n<a href=\"https://github.com/nickk752/CryptoCards\">here.</a> In this post I’ll try to\nbreak down mistakes we made, what we did right, and things that I learned\nalong the way. </p>\n<h3>Initial Goals and Adjustments</h3>\n<p>When we first set out, we had some very high hopes for this website, that\nfrom a high level looked like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can buy and sell cards on the site via auctions on the blockchain</li>\n<li>Users can combine cards to create new ones</li>\n<li>Users can build decks with their cards, and battle via a browser-based game</li>\n<li>Game logic on the blockchain to prevent cheating</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’m happy to say we did eventually provide most of that functionality, though\nat the expense of some visual polish. The only goal we had to drop entirely\nwas putting game logic on the blockchain, as research quickly showed it would\nrequire people to spend an unreasonable amount of ether on playing a game, so\nwe marked it as unfeasible. </p>\n<p>Some other smaller features also had to be dropped. We wanted to store the art\nfor the cards on the blockchain as well, but it also appeared unfeasible.\nI was supposed to develop a ranked matchmaking system for players, but had to\ngo for random matches instead, unfortunatly not because it wasn’t feasible but\nbecause I was running out of time, for reasons you’ll find below.</p>\n<h3>Mistakes</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail</p>\n<p> <cite> Benjamin Franklin </cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are two big mistakes I want to talk about here, one pertinent to the\nwhole team, and one more on me personally. Both revolve around preperation. </p>\n<p>As a team, we didn’t invest enough effort in planning our project, both through user\nstories and code architechture. While we were required to create stories and post them to\nthe management system the class was using, we often just phoned it in - not\nreally going into the amount of detail we should have. This became apparent\nlater on in the development process, when we encountered parts of the system\nthat didn’t work together as they should have even when implimented correctly,\nor that left functionality gaps, forcing us to shove what we needed where it\nwould fit, never a good strategy when dealing with this many moving parts. It\nwas shocking how much smoother things were moving on the chunks with proper design,\njust pick up a task, impliment the required small bit of functionality, run\nthe tests, rinse, and repeat until you logged your hours for the day. In contrast,\nwhen things were ambiguous, </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"CryptoCards - A Blockchain Cardgame Retrospective","date":"February 17, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/CryptoCards-Blockchain-Cardgame-Retrospective/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/Hello-World/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/Frequency-Visualizer-Retrospective/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Frequency Visualizer Retrospective"}}}}
