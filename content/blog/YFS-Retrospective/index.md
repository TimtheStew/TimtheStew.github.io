As a nearly semester-long project for a distributed systems class, we were to
implement a distributed filesystem called YFS, based on an [MIT 6.824 project](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/6.824-2012/labs/)
Below I'll outline the good, bad, and ugly about the project, as well as some 
lessons I learned.
