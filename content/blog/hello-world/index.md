My first blog post!

Not much to put here, really liking working with Gatsby. Been working on some
retrospectives of the projects I've got on my resume, hoping to start this blog
as sort of an extension of my resume actually, so if anyone is interested in 
my projects they can come read about them here. Beyond that I'm hoping to do 
some write-ups of the technologies and techniques involved in those projects, 
like fourier analysis for the visualizer and the dope algorithms used in (or 
just related to) the YFS file system.
