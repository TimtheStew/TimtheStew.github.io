a new project. We’ve wanted to build something together for some time
but kept throwing around ideas without actually starting. So finally
we just picked one that interested us both, and went for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umbrella Chat is going to be an end-to-end encrypted chat service built
as a 12-factor web-app. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/TimtheStew/umbrella-chat&quot;&gt;Check out the source here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Stack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the back-end, we’re using Apollo Server, for ease of setting up
a GraphQL API, and Sequelize as an ORM tool for our Postgres DB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the front, we’re using webpack to bundle our assets, babel to maintain
compatibility, React to display a UI, and Redux to manage our state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That all sounds great! Modern and buzzword-y! But what does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well strap in, and let me tell you…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back-End&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://graphql.org/&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; is an alternative to traditional RESTful
API’s, developed at facebook. The basic idea behind it is that instead of
having lots of endpoints for very specific queries, you have one
“smart” endpoint, that delivers just the data the client needs, and in whatever
configuration they need it. This cuts down on data processing on the front end, and
means you don’t have to write a new query every time your front-end needs a
different collection of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A GraphQL server is a layer that sits between your front end and your data store(s).
It works with three main components: Schemas, Queries, and Resolvers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GraphQL’s typed &lt;strong&gt;schemas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/essentials/schema#sdl&quot;&gt;Schema Definition Language&lt;/a&gt;
are at the core of how it functions. A schema is how you describe your data and
it’s types to graphql. SDL offers several scalar types (bools, ints, strings, etc.)
and some abstractions, like objects, to allow you to define your data in terms
of types and relationships. For instance a rudimentary Chat definition might
look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;type Chat&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token constant&quot;&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;
    name&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; String
    users&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;String&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    createdAt&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; String
    updatedAt&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; String
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other things you’ll probably want to include in schemas, such as extensions
to the Query and Mutation types, but I won’t get into those here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Queries&lt;/strong&gt; are how you ask for the data you want, and are store-agnostic! It doesn’t
matter where what you need comes from, GraphQL takes care of that for you. They can
also take arguments, which plays into that “only the data you need” idea.
So lets say I wanted a chat with a particular id, my query might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;query&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;chat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;id&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;someUUID&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        name
        users
        updatedAt
        createdAt
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since both queries and schemas don’t care about where things come from, you figure
something has to right? Thats where &lt;strong&gt;resolvers&lt;/strong&gt; come in! A resolver does what
it says on the tin - it resolves abstract queries into concrete data by following
the procedures you lay out for it. More simply, it tells GraphQL where and how to look
for what it wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GraphQL is really just a specification, and can be implemented in any language. For this
project the implementation we’re using is
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/&quot;&gt;Apollo Server&lt;/a&gt; which allows for
easy set-up and auto-documenting of the API your GraphQL server uses. It also
offers compatibility with a wide range of sources
(such as a Postgres DB) and is popular, well-documented and well-maintained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our database, we’re using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postgresql.org/&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt;, which
is an open source object-relational database system. It has an emphasis on
extensibility and standards compliance, as well as a wide support base, given
it is the DB of choice for many individuals and organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ease of querying our database, we’re using an ORM, or Object Relational Mapping
(library) called &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.sequelizejs.com/&quot;&gt;Sequelize&lt;/a&gt;. Sequelize is a
promise based Javascript ORM, that supports a handful of popular DBs such
as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, &lt;strong&gt;Postgres&lt;/strong&gt;, and SQLite. It’s purpose is to hide the
mechanics of SQL querying behind an object model. So instead of
writing a statement like &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; chats &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; name &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;My Squad&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you would do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;Chat&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;findAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  where&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    name &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&apos;My Squad&apos;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with such a trivial example, it might seem we’ve actually made things
more complicated, but as queries grow in demand or generality, they can become quite tricky to write
optimally, and that is where Sequelize really shines. It means that I don’t
have to be a SQL master to use fast queries, and the object model can greatly
simplify other more ungainly selections. However, since Sequelize isn’t familiar
with the ins and outs of my data, I can’t expect it be as good as an actual SQL master
at writing queries, but I can expect it to be better than me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This object model is how our GraphQL resolvers will return the data they need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an ORM allows us to employ some OOP techniques to better manage and define our data,
even at the database level. Also, because it abstracts the DB, we could switch to any other DB supported by
Sequelize down the line without too much hassle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Front-End&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front of our front-end is &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/&quot;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;. React is a two-part
framework for creating UI’s in a browser or “browser-like” environment. One part
is React itself, which uses components, and their associated objects like props, to
describe at once both the visual and functional aspects of a UI. The other part is &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html&quot;&gt;React-DOM,&lt;/a&gt;
which is a virtual &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction&quot;&gt;DOM&lt;/a&gt;that allows for faster loading and changing of the page through optimized DOM management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with android development, React components are very similar to activities and fragments, in that they’re modular pieces which represent screens or sections of screens. For example,
you might have a page level component for a login page, which contains several other
components such as a header, footer, loginModal, etc. It may also contain other non-visual components,
which just perform some background logic,
these are more akin to an android service. And since all these components are modular, you can reuse them,
so all of your page level components (often called containers, or views, or something similar) can use the
same header and footer components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, similar to android, these components will usually be subclasses of the main React.Component class, and follow a lifecycle, with callbacks corresponding to
various points in that lifecycle, such as when they are about to mount, or just have mounted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core ideas of React is the marriage of display logic and functionality. To this end,
React uses something called &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html&quot;&gt;JSX&lt;/a&gt; which
is an extension for Javascript that allows for the direct embedding of markup syntax into Javascript.
Jsx is how components are defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While React has built-in functionality for managing the state of each component in your application,
it can get head-scratchingly complicated as your application grows. Some component updates
your data, which updates a couple other components, which updates your data, which updates other components…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce this headache, we use a state container called &lt;a href=&quot;https://redux.js.org/&quot;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt;. So that
instead of having to micro-manage the state of our application at a per-component level, we
can do it all in one place - the redux store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The store contains the state of our entire application, usually in something like a map, which it doles
out as props to our various components. Whenever our components trigger an Action, redux reduces that
action to changes in the store, which will cause our components to update with new props. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our front-end is connected to the backend using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/&quot;&gt;Apollo Client&lt;/a&gt;.
It has some very convienent features,
especially when used with React. It lets us create Query Components, which
encapsulates a lot of data-fetching tasks nicely into a pattern that fits well
with React and Redux. It also ships with an intelligent cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the back-end of the front end, we use some pre-processing to turn all our code into
a website. We have a couple smaller pre-processerers like one for SASS, which lets us write
more robust CSS. A major pre-processor is &lt;a href=&quot;https://babeljs.io/&quot;&gt;babel&lt;/a&gt; which is really
a transpiler. It lets us write modern ES6 javascript, which is not yet fully supported
by all browsers, by converting it into ES5 javascript that is. For example it would turn
this code, utilizing lambda functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; odds &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; evens&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;v &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; v &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; nums &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; evens&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;v&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&gt;&lt;/span&gt; v &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into this, which doesn’t:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; odds &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; evens&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;v&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; v &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; nums &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; evens&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;v&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; v &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this preprocessing, and more (such as minification), is handled by &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.js.org/&quot;&gt;WebPack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebPack, along with providing all the task-running functionality described above (applying
those processors in a specified order), also builds a dependency graph of our all our
static and non-static assets, from CSS to images. I’m not going to go too deep into it here,
there are plenty of great resources describing the webpack process all over the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long
and the short of it is that webpack allows us require() in the browser. This means instead
of having to hand order concatened javascript files, and &lt;strong&gt;rely on global variables&lt;/strong&gt; we can make use of the modulization
provided by require(). Webpack will assemble all our javascript into
the minimal amount of files, and, with the help of an HTML plugin, directly insert those
scripts in the right order into a template HTML file. It will take all these files,
modified to properly include the static assets, and put them into a directory for
distribution. Boom, website!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The End&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ve enjoyed the read. Stay tuned for the next post where I’ll go over
what it means for this app to be 12 factor!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[YFS - A Distributed Filesystem Retrospective - WIP]]></title><description><![CDATA[As a nearly semester-long project for a distributed systems class, we were to

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Lay of the Land&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first big mistake I made during this project involved my outlook on C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, having at this point completed two C based courses, one on low level computing,
with an introduction to C, and the next Operating Systems, where we rebuilt
some system fundamentals ourselves in C, I felt somewhat confident with things
like pointers and raw memory management. And, here comes the mistake, I took that
confidence and extended it into C++, thinking something along the lines of “C++ is just
C with classes”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement is in a sense “technically” true, but also very misleading. The reality of writing
C++, especially more modern C++11, or 14 (or 17), is very different to writing C. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This became especially apparent when we were discussing our solutions to the first portion
of the project in class. Where some of my classmates had made quick work of adding
the extent functionality required by using C++ STL utilities like maps and vectors, I had
done everything C-style with arrays and far more pointer headaches than necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be continued…&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Frequency Visualizer Retrospective]]></title><description><![CDATA[One of my favorite projects, my friend Quentin and I spent a few weeks

with the Fast Fourier Transform and it’s plethora of applications since my
business school days, it seemed a natural choice to build some sort of spectrum
visualizer. The other main idea that seemed appealing was doing something with a cluster
of Raspberry Pis, but we weren’t sure what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sine-tones-4094d5c2b6fc461b35580ca046d859e4.gif&quot; alt=&quot;sine-tones&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=center&gt;
    &lt;cite&gt; Sine tones, increasing in frequency(Hz) and decreasing in decibels(DBFS) &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Initial Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the first times, aside from hackathons or personal projects,
where we as students were given the go ahead to create or choose our own
projects. And so, like the naive young fools we were, we set ourselves some
very ambitious goals. Also, as we were still really keen on that Raspberry Pi
idea, we managed to shove them in somewhere too. We wanted to build rhythm game with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple color-schemes and display modes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tap keys or click moving objects in time with music, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/&quot;&gt;OpenGL 4&lt;/a&gt; to display 3D graphics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using MIT’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fftw.org/&quot;&gt;fftw&lt;/a&gt; to perform the analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the insistence of our professor, we were to do the FFT in real-time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of this was to happen on a Raspberry Pi, and be controlled wirelessly. (so you could
plug it into a TV and play from your couch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Big Mistake: Adjusting Goals for the Real-World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we soon found out that not only were most of those goals unfeasible in
the few scant weeks we had (we were also both busy with other classes) they were also way
over our heads technically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about a week of bashing our heads against the wall that is OpenGl 4’s programmable pipeline,
we decided to instead used the fixed-function pipeline of OpenGL 2, and to do 2D graphics with it, as
it seemed much more conquerable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of us had ever
developed a game at all, let alone in something as low level as OpenGL, so the interactive
component went by the wayside as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As relative newbies to the FFT signal processing scene, we opted
for the more beginner friendly FFT module from &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.fft.html&quot;&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt;.
Finally, as the rapberry pi’s we ordered weren’t set to arrive until shortly
before it was due (too cheap to pay for express shipping) we dropped that as well. Though the
ubuntu version of the project probably wouldn’t be that hard to port over to a Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it felt bad at the time to cut down our dreams for the project so much, it was worth it at
the end to produce a working program. It was also a big learning experience, if we had set more
reasonable goals from the get go, we could have polished our project up a lot more at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, as you may notice, the gifs on this page dont look quite like a spectrum display you’d
see on a stereo system or from a music player. That’s because we display the frequency spectrum
linearly, instead of logarithmically. So the first 20% of the vertical bins should really take up most
of the screen. We also never got around to labelling the axis with the Decibels or Frequencies. If we hadn’t
wasted all that time starting to learn tools we didn’t end up using, we could have easily added
those features, as well as multiple color schemes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Good Part&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this project was beset with many downgrades, there were some nice moments along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/mozart-violin-final-b146a6a11094e769c0495e0a85890235.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Mozart-Violin&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=center&gt;
    &lt;cite&gt; A couple seconds of Mozart&apos;s Symphony No.35 in D major IV - Finale Presto &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
While it could certainly be improved, our primitive syncing method works quite well. It turns out
the issue of syncing audio to graphics - or rather of keeping them synced once playback has begun, can be
very tricky, especially with audio longer than your average video game sound-effect. Evidence for this abounds in even 
modern games, where slowdown often causes dialogue de-sync. 
&lt;p&gt;Our GUI create two processes,
one for openGL to display the graphics, and another python one for the analysis. The stdout of the analysis
process is piped into the stdin for the input, then they both exec their respective programs, and playback
begins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned a lot of how FFT’s like this need to be done, and the various pre-processing methods
you have to employ to get accurate data. You have to deal with multiple channels, filtering, and perhaps
most frustrating, windowing - because unless you generate your own sine tones, music is never going to
be periodic in a 1024 sample window. While conceptually windowing isn’t too hard to understand, adjusting
for it post-FFT was touch and go for a while there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular I remember the moment I finally got the FFT program to output the correct decibels.
After a couple days of tweaking parameters and multipliers, finagling the high-pass filtering, and reading many,
many, guides on fourier audio analysis (all of which seemed to have a piece of what we needed, but not all)
when my sine tone wav files actually gave me the output I was hoping for, I actually did a little
dance in celebration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though we didn’t meet most of our initial goals, I still consider this project a success. I learned a lot,
both personally and technically. Afterwards I felt much better equipped to tackle the projects I wanted - I felt
I could more realistically gauge the amount I’d be able to accomplish, or least learn how to gauge it by surveying
the landscape I desire to enter. I also picked up technical skills, in the basics of digital signal processing,
fourier analysis, and OpenGL. Not to mention I sharpened my python teeth, having mainly used it in the past for
things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://projecteuler.net/&quot;&gt;Project Euler&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/&quot;&gt;DailyProgrammer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest lesson I learned is to be more realistic about what I can achieve, which will spare
me a lot of heartache, and also let me go the farthest I can in the time I have.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[CryptoCards - A Blockchain Cardgame Retrospective]]></title><description><![CDATA[As one of the final projects for my degree at Temple University, 5 friends and I

    &lt;cite&gt; The cardback art used in-game &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Initial Goals and Adjustments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we first set out, learning from previous projects where we were over-ambitious,
we had some moderately lofty but not too extreme goals for this website, that
from a high level looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users can buy and sell cards on the site via auctions on the blockchain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users can combine cards to create new ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users can build decks with their cards, and battle via a browser-based game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game logic on the blockchain to prevent cheating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to say we did eventually provide most of that functionality, though
at the expense of much visual polish. The only goal we had to drop entirely
was putting game logic on the blockchain, as research quickly showed it would
require people to spend an unreasonable amount of ether on playing a game, so
we marked it as unfeasible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some other smaller features also had to be dropped. We wanted to store the art
for the cards on the blockchain as well, but it also appeared unfeasible.
I was supposed to develop a ranked matchmaking system for players, but had to
go for random matches instead, unfortunately not because it wasn’t feasible but
because I was running out of time, for reasons you’ll find below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mistakes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;cite&gt; Benjamin Franklin &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two big mistakes I want to talk about here, one pertinent to the
whole team, and one more on me personally. Both revolve around preparation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a team, we didn’t invest enough effort in planning our project, both through user
stories and more general architecture, such as block, sequence, or module diagrams.
While we were required to create all that documentation and stories and post them to
the management system the class was using, we sometimes just phoned it in - not
really going into the amount of detail we should have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this was a major problem became apparent
later on in the development process, when we encountered parts of the system
that didn’t work together as they should have even when implemented correctly,
or that left functionality gaps, forcing us to shove what we needed where it
would fit, never a good strategy when dealing with this many moving parts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was shocking how much smoother things were moving on the modules with proper design,
just pick up a task, implement the required small bit of functionality, run
the tests, rinse, and repeat until you logged your hours for the day. In contrast,
when things were ambiguous, even a task that should have been run of the mill could
require you to talk to 2 or 3 different team members about how something should be
done, and if you weren’t very familiar with the rest of the components it was to interact with,
you may leave your implementation lacking some functionality that wasn’t specified.
Once a couple such modules have been added, if not properly
documented, they could snowball into complicating even well planned parts of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we all participated in the design and, to an extent, the implementation of the
entire project, early on we split into three two-person teams, one focused on the
smart contracts, one on the main website, and one on the game. I was on the game team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more personal mistake I want to talk about involves a lack of preparation with regards
to developing multiplayer browser games. While I did some small demos and tutorials to
get a feel for the tools involved (&lt;a href=&quot;https://phaser.io/&quot;&gt;phaser&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://socket.io/&quot;&gt;socket.io&lt;/a&gt; mostly) I didn’t do much research into the common
patterns and best practices used in the design of such programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant when I initially designed
the structure of the games objects and interactions, not only were my modules not as
efficient and self-contained as they easily could have been - I also alienated myself
from a good portion of the resources available to me. No one online can help me
understand why my janky resource system sometimes doesn’t update when it should, when
none of my events to trigger such an update are patterns used by others. If I had followed
through with the tutorials I started instead of just stopping when I knew I could get
the functionality I wanted, I would be able to continue to draw on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another related problem was that this was my first real exposure to anything more than
trivial javascript. So while I did spend a good deal of time researching and learning
throughout the project, a lot of that was focused on learning the in’s and out’s of
JS, and ES6 in particular. I did come out of it with a much more positive view of JS
than I had before though. I used to think of it as kind of a joke, knowing it mostly for
it’s meme-y quirks surrounding type coercion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of javascript knowledge lead to some terrible initial designs based using
prototypical inheritance, and an eventual switch to ES6 - which I should’ve just used
from the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more minor (technically speaking) issue with the whole project was that the card game
we designed was by no means balanced, or even really that fun. But as none of us really
studied any game design in that sense, and it didn’t impact the ability of the game to
be played, I don’t view it as that big of a problem. People still play monopoly, even
when vastly superior board games are available!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Went Well&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, we did manage to pull off most of the functionality. Using a chrome
plugin to connect to their wallet, users could purchase cards for Ether on the site, and
then create an auction to sell them
if they wanted, or put them into a deck, and (if they were
lucky) load that deck into the game to play with. While not entirely bug-free, and
certainly not as pretty as we’d hoped, everything did work correctly for the final demo.
(though due to the planning mistakes outlined above, not much earlier than that)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the site’s interaction with the smart contracts and the game were tricky and took
many more redesigns and ad hoc adjustments than anyone sensible would admit to,
the actual site itself was mostly smooth sailing, based on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mern.io/&quot;&gt;MERN&lt;/a&gt; stack
(MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) it had an account system, an inventory management page,
and an auction house, as well pages for describing the game and how the cards worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a lot of similar work on non-fungible token systems on the blockchain, see
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cryptokitties.co/&quot;&gt;CryptoKitties,&lt;/a&gt; the blockchain work went fairly well, at least
as far I know, only being at best semi-involved in that part of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I’m proud of is the zone system I made for the game-board, that allowed easy drag and
dropping of cards from hands to the battlefield, as well as summary state updates to be sent
between players as they took actions. It was incredibly satisfying the first time I played a card as player
1 and saw the card appear in the appropriate spot for player 2. Phaser was a lot of fun to work with, and is fairly
well documented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good part was the art for the game, sometimes we would take breaks during long frustrating
nights coding in a CS lounge on campus and just make pixel art for the cards. While none of it was
awe-inspiring, it was a lot of fun to make, and we even made a card poking (light-hearted) fun at our professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Big Lessons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think there are three big takeaways from my experience with this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More work in the design stage means less frustration in the implementation stage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best practices and common patterns are widely used for a reason, and to be ignorant of
them risks cutting yourself off from potential resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build familiarity with tools on small projects before you attempt to design large projects
to be built with them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello World! Blog Goals]]></title><description><![CDATA[My first blog post! Not much to put here, really liking working with Gatsby. Been working on some

&lt;p&gt;Not much to put here, really liking working with Gatsby. Been working on some
retrospectives of the projects I’ve got on my resume, hoping to start this blog
as sort of an extension of my resume actually, so if anyone is interested in
my projects they can come read about them here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that I’m hoping to do
some write-ups of the technologies and techniques involved in those projects,
like fourier analysis or OpenGL for the visualizer and the dope algorithms
used in (or just related to) the YFS file system. I’ll also be putting any
interesting tidbits related to future projects here. Maybe I’ll do a post about
Gatsby, because although I’m sure there are already many, many such posts
around, none of them are mine!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
