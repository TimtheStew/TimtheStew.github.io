# Tim's Blog 
Based on [this Gatsby starter blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)

Initially the blog will just be looking back on projects I've already done, and
breakdowns of some of the cool tech involved in them. The plan is 
to keep it updated with projects I'll do in the future.
