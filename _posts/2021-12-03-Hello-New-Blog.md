My last blog (which all posts prior to this one came from) was a much plainer looking 
Gatsby static site. The github pages/jekyll experience has really been streamlined since 
then, and this time instead of using Gatsby, I'm going with just a theme on regular jekyll.

Big shoutout to [@TaylanTatli](https://github.com/TaylanTatli) on Github for [this theme,](https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Moon) 
even though they haven't 
touched it in 5 years, all it needed was dependency updates and some minor 
fixes to work perfectly again. Trimmed down the sections a bit, swap out the content
(my old posts were also in markdown, just with slightly different metadata) and voila!

Spent half a Saturday setting this up and editing 
down the frequency visualizer operating description into what will be
the first real post of the 'reboot'. Whether or not this reboot will be 
any less short lived than the original remains to be seen. 

Happy to be blogging again,    
Tim
